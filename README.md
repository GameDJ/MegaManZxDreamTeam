Autosplitter


~READ ME~

About: Resets have to be done manually when the IGT is static - in the Main Menu
After starting livesplit will keep track of the IGT all the time, it works everytime
in the run, e.g. if you forget to start the timer, and you start it later in the run
it will still be accurate because it runs by IGT of the game itself. (This can happen if you don't let
the script start runs by itself).

Setup: Edit Layout: + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter, browse for the script file
Have fun and accurate timing c:
